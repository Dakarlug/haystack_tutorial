Its position, on the western edge of Africa, is an advantageous departure point for trans-Atlantic and European trade; this fact aided its growth into a major regional port.\n\nAccording to December 31, 2005 official estimates, the city of Dakar proper has a population of 1,030,594, whereas the population of the Dakar metropolitan area is estimated at 2.45&nbsp;million people.     \n\nDakar is a major administrative centre, home to the National Assembly of Senegal and Senegals Presidents Palace.\n\n==History==\n \n Portuguese reached one of these stops, in 1501, where the Florentine navigator Amerigo Vespucci began to construct his \"New World\" hypothesis about America. )\n Admiral Robert Holmes on January 23, 1664, and finally to the French in 1677. Though under continuous French administration since, m\u00e9tis families, descended from Dutch and French traders and African wives, dominated the slave trade. The infamous \"House of Slaves\" was built here in 1776.\n\nIn 1795 the Lebou of Cape Verde revolted against Cayor rule. A new theocratic state, subsequently called the \"Lebou Republic\" by the French, was established under the leadership of the Diop, a Muslim clerical family originally from Koki in Cayor. The capital of the republic was established at Ndakaaru. In 1857 the French established a military post at Ndakaaru (which they called \"Dakar\") and annexed the Lebou Republic, though its institutions continued to function nominally. The Serigne (also spelled S\u00ebri\u00f1, \"Lord\") of Ndakaaru is still recognized as the traditional political authority of the Lebou by the Senegalese State today.\n\nThe slave trade was abolished by France in February 1794. However, Napoleon reinstated it in May 1802, then finally abolished it permanently in March 1815. Despite Napoleons abolition, a clandestine slave trade continued at Gor\u00e9e until 1848, when it was abolished throughout all French territories. To replace trade in slaves, the French promoted peanut cultivation on the mainland. As the peanut trade boomed, tiny Gor\u00e9e Island, whose population had grown to 6,000&nbsp;residents, proved ineffectual as a port. Traders from Gor\u00e9e decided to move to the mainland and a \"factory\" with warehouses was established in Rufisque in 1840.\n \nLarge public expenditure for infrastructure was allocated by the colonial authorities to Dakars development. The port facilities were improved with jetties, a telegraph line was established along the coast to Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis and the Dakar-Saint-Louis railway was completed in 1885, at which point the city became an important base for the conquest of the western Sudan.\n \n \nGor\u00e9e, including Dakar, was recognised as a French commune in 1872. Dakar itself was split off from Gor\u00e9e as a separate commune in 1887. The citizens of the city elected their own mayor and municipal council and helped send an elected representative to the National Assembly in Paris. Dakar replaced Saint-Louis as the capital of French West Africa in 1902. A second major railroad, the Dakar-Niger railway|Dakar-Niger built from 1906\u20131923, linked Dakar to Bamako and consolidated the citys position at the head of Frances West African empire. In 1929, the commune of Gor\u00e9e Island, now with only a few hundred inhabitants, was merged into Dakar.\n\nUrbanization during the colonial period was marked by forms of racial and social segregation\u2014often expressed in terms of health and hygiene\u2014which continue to structure the city today. Following a plague epidemic in 1914, the authorities forced most of the African population out of old neighborhoods, or \"Plateau\", and into a new quarter, called M\u00e9dina, separated from it by a \"sanitary cordon\". As first occupants of the land, the Lebou inhabitants of the city successfully resisted this expropriation. They were supported by Blaise Diagne, the first African to be elected Deputy to the National Assembly. Nonetheless, the Plateau thereafter became an administrative, commercial, and residential district increasingly reserved for Europeans and served as model for similar exclusionary administrative enclaves in French Africas other colonial capitals (Bamako, Conakry, Abidjan, Brazzaville). Meanwhile, the Layene Sufi order, established by Seydina Mouhammadou Limamou Laye, was thriving among the Lebou in Yoff and in a new village called Camb\u00e9r\u00e8ne. Since independence, urbanization has sprawled eastward past Pikine, a commuter suburb whose population (2001 est. 1,200,000) is greater than that of Dakar proper, to Rufisque, creating a conurbation of almost 3&nbsp;million (over a quarter of the national population).\n\nIn its colonial heyday Dakar was one of the major cities of the French Empire, comparable to Hanoi or Beirut. French trading firms established branch offices there and industrial investments (mills, breweries, refineries, canneries) were attracted by its port and rail facilities. It was also strategically important to France, which maintained an important naval base and coaling station in its harbor and which integrated it into its earliest air force and airmail circuits, most notably with the legendary Mermoz airfield (no longer extant).\n\nDuring the Battle of Dakar, which took place off the coast of Dakar on September 23\u201325, 1940, the British navy attempted to rally the colonial administration in Dakar to the Allied cause and detach it from Vichy. In November 1944 West African conscripts of the French army mutinied against poor conditions at the Thiaroye camp, on the outskirts of the city. The mutiny was seen as an indictment of the colonial system and constituted a watershed for the nationalist movement.\n\nDakar was the capital of the short-lived Mali Federation from 1959 to 1960, after which it became the capital of Senegal. The poet, philosopher and first President of Senegal L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor tried to transform Dakar into the \"Sub-Saharan African Athens\" (l\u2019Ath\u00e8nes de l\u2019Afrique subsaharienne),  as his vision was for it.\n Lebanese community Cape Verdean, and Guinean communities. The city is home to as many as 20,000&nbsp;French expatriates. France still maintains an air force base at Yoff and the French fleet is serviced in Dakars port.\n\nBeginning 1978 and until 2007, Dakar was frequently the ending point of the Dakar Rally. The rally brought worldwide attention to the poverty of Senegal and Dakar. \n\n==Geography and climate==\n \nThe Dakarian climate is generally warm. Dakar has a hot semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: BSh), with a short rainy season and a lengthy dry season. Dakars rainy season lasts from July to October while the dry season covers the remaining eight months. The city sees approximately   of precipitation per year.\n\nDakar between December and May is usually pleasantly warm with daily temperatures around  . Nights during this time of the year are comfortable, some  . However, between May and November the city becomes decidedly warmer with daily highs reaching   and night lows a little bit above  . Notwithstanding this hotter season Dakars weather is far from being as hot as that of African cities inland, such as Niamey and NDjamena, where temperatures hover above   for much of the year. It has presumably the best climate settings in all western Africa, as it is cooled year-round with sea breezes.\n\n{{Weather box location = Dakar, Senegal metric first= Y single line= Y Jan record high C=37 Feb record high C=40 Mar record high C=40 Apr record high C=39 May record high C=37 Jun record high C=39 Jul record high C=40 Aug record high C=40 Sep record high C=42 Oct record high C=40 Nov record high C=43 Dec record high C=39\n Jan high C = 25 Feb high C = 24.6 Mar high C = 25 Apr high C = 25.3 May high C = 26.3 Jun high C = 28.9 Jul high C = 30 Aug high C = 30.1 Sep high C = 30.4 Oct high C = 30.4 Nov high C = 29 Dec high C = 26.5 year high C = 27.6\n Jan mean C=22 Feb mean C=21.7 Mar mean C=22.2 Apr mean C=22.6 May mean C=23.4 Jun mean C=26.5 Jul mean C=27.4 Aug mean C=27.4 Sep mean C=27.8 Oct mean C=28.1 Nov mean C=26.4 Dec mean C=23.6\n Jan low C = 17.4 Feb low C = 17 Mar low C = 17.4 Apr low C = 18.4 May low C = 20.2 Jun low C = 23.1 Jul low C = 24.5 Aug low C = 24.6 Sep low C = 24.4 Oct low C = 24.3 Nov low C = 22.5 Dec low C = 19.6 year low C = 21.1\n Jan record low C=11 Feb record low C=10 Mar record low C=10 Apr record low C=10 May record low C=17 Jun record low C=17 Jul record low C=13 Aug record low C=19 Sep record low C=17 Oct record low C=18 Nov record low C=16 Dec record low C=12\n Jan precipitation mm = 2.1 Feb precipitation mm = 1.3 Mar precipitation mm = 0 Apr precipitation mm = 0 May precipitation mm = 0 Jun precipitation mm = 10.2 Jul precipitation mm = 83.4 Aug precipitation mm = 184 Sep precipitation mm =  156.5 Oct precipitation mm =  51.6 Nov precipitation mm =  2.6 Dec precipitation mm =  2.6 year precipitation mm = 495.1\n\n  unit precipitation days = 1 mm\n Jan precipitation days = 0 Feb precipitation days = 0 Mar precipitation days = 0 Apr precipitation days = 0 May precipitation days = 0 Jun precipitation days = 1 Jul precipitation days = 4 Aug precipitation days = 9 Sep precipitation days = 8 Oct precipitation days = 2 Nov precipitation days = 0 Dec precipitation days = 0 year precipitation days = 25\n Jan humidity= 69 Feb humidity= 75 Mar humidity= 76 Apr humidity= 79 May humidity= 79 Jun humidity= 78 Jul humidity= 77 Aug humidity= 79 Sep humidity= 81 Oct humidity= 79 Nov humidity= 74 Dec humidity= 66 year humidity= 76\n Jan sun = 244.9 Feb sun = 245.8 Mar sun = 276 Apr sun = 288 May sun = 291.4 Jun sun = 252 Jul sun = 232.5 Aug sun = 223.2 Sep sun = 219 Oct sun = 257.3 Nov sun = 249 Dec sun = 238.7\n\n  Jan percentsun= 70 Feb percentsun= 74 Mar percentsun= 74 Apr percentsun= 74 May percentsun= 73 Jun percentsun= 65 Jul percentsun= 58 Aug percentsun= 57 Sep percentsun= 60 Oct percentsun= 70 Nov percentsun= 73 Dec percentsun= 69\n source 1 = Spiegel Online Wetter   \n\n|date=March 2012\n source 2 = Climate-Data.org for mean temperatures,  Voodoo Skies for records   \n\n}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Dakar mean sea temperature   \n|-\n!Jan\n!Feb\n!Mar\n!Apr\n!May\n!Jun\n!Jul\n!Aug\n!Sep\n!Oct\n!Nov\n!Dec\n|-\n| \n| \n| \n| \n| \n| \n| \n| \n| \n| \n| \n| \n|}\n\n==Administration==\n \n \nThe city of Dakar is a commune (subnational entity)|commune, (also sometimes known as commune de ville), one of the 67&nbsp;communes of Senegal. The commune of Dakar was created by the French colonial administration on June 17, 1887 by detaching it from the commune of Gor\u00e9e. The commune of Gor\u00e9e, created in 1872, was itself one of the oldest Western-style municipalities in Africa (along with the municipalities of Algeria and South Africa).\n Mamadou Diop, mayor for 18&nbsp;years between 1984 and 2002.\n\nThe commune of Dakar is also a d\u00e9partement, one of the 34&nbsp;d\u00e9partements of Senegal. This situation is quite similar to Paris, which is both a commune and a d\u00e9partement. However, contrary to French d\u00e9partements, d\u00e9partements in Senegal have no political power (no departmental assembly), and are merely local administrative structures of the central state, in charge of carrying out some administrative services as well as controlling the activities of the communes within the d\u00e9partement.\n departmental arrondissements.\n \n \nIn 1996 a massive reform of the administrative and political divisions of Senegal was voted by the Parliament of Senegal. The commune of Dakar, whose population approached 1&nbsp;million inhabitants, was deemed too large and too populated to be properly managed by a central municipality, and thus on August 30, 1996 Dakar was divided into 19&nbsp;communes darrondissement. These communes darrondissement were given extensive powers, and are very much like regular communes. They have more powers than the arrondissements of Paris, and are more akin to the London boroughs. The commune of Dakar was maintained above these 19&nbsp;communes darrondissement, and it coordinates the activities of the communes darrondissement, much as Greater London coordinates the activities of the London boroughs. The 19&nbsp;communes darrondissement belong to either of the four arrondissements of Dakar, and the prefect|sous-pr\u00e9fet of each arrondissement is in charge of controlling the activities of the communes darrondissement in his arrondissement.\n\nThe commune darrondissement of Dakar-Plateau (34,626 inhabitants), in the arrondissement of Plateau/Gor\u00e9e, is the historical heart of the city, and most ministries and public administrations are located there. The densest and most populous commune darrondissement is M\u00e9dina (136,697&nbsp;inhabitants), in the arrondissement of Plateau/Gor\u00e9e. The commune darrondissement of Yoff (55,995&nbsp;inhabitants), in the arrondissement of Almadies, is the largest one, while the smallest one is the commune darrondissement of Gor\u00e9e|\u00cele de Gor\u00e9e (1,034&nbsp;inhabitants), in the arrondissement of Plateau/Gor\u00e9e.\n Cape Verde Peninsula. Its territory is thus roughly the same as the territory of the metropolitan area of Dakar. Since the administrative reforms of 1996, the r\u00e9gions of Senegal, which until then were merely local administrative structures of the central state, have been turned into full-fledged political units, with democratically elected regional councils, and regional presidents. They were given extensive powers, and manage economic development, transportation, or environmental protection issues at the regional level, thus coordinating the actions of the communes below them.\n\nAbdoulaye Wade was re-elected in 2007.\n\n==Notable places==\n \n \n ]] tallest statue in Africa, clifftop walks and beaches, and  , aka the Senegal Zoo.\n\nThe town serves as a port and is home to the Dakar-Yoff-L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor International Airport|L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor International Airport.

Its position, on the western edge of Africa, is an advantageous departure point for trans-Atlantic and European trade; this fact aided its growth into a major regional port.\n\nAccording to December 31, 2005 official estimates, the city of Dakar proper has a population of 1,030,594, whereas the population of the Dakar metropolitan area is estimated at 2.45&nbsp;million people.     \n\nDakar is a major administrative centre, home to the National Assembly of Senegal and Senegals Presidents Palace.\n\n==History==\n \n Portuguese reached one of these stops, in 1501, where the Florentine navigator Amerigo Vespucci began to construct his \"New World\" hypothesis about America. )\n Admiral Robert Holmes on January 23, 1664, and finally to the French in 1677. Though under continuous French administration since, m\u00e9tis families, descended from Dutch and French traders and African wives, dominated the slave trade. The infamous \"House of Slaves\" was built here in 1776.\n\nIn 1795 the Lebou of Cape Verde revolted against Cayor rule. A new theocratic state, subsequently called the \"Lebou Republic\" by the French, was established under the leadership of the Diop, a Muslim clerical family originally from Koki in Cayor. The capital of the republic was established at Ndakaaru. In 1857 the French established a military post at Ndakaaru (which they called \"Dakar\") and annexed the Lebou Republic, though its institutions continued to function nominally. The Serigne (also spelled S\u00ebri\u00f1, \"Lord\") of Ndakaaru is still recognized as the traditional political authority of the Lebou by the Senegalese State today.\n\nThe slave trade was abolished by France in February 1794. However, Napoleon reinstated it in May 1802, then finally abolished it permanently in March 1815. Despite Napoleons abolition, a clandestine slave trade continued at Gor\u00e9e until 1848, when it was abolished throughout all French territories. To replace trade in slaves, the French promoted peanut cultivation on the mainland. As the peanut trade boomed, tiny Gor\u00e9e Island, whose population had grown to 6,000&nbsp;residents, proved ineffectual as a port. Traders from Gor\u00e9e decided to move to the mainland and a \"factory\" with warehouses was established in Rufisque in 1840.\n \nLarge public expenditure for infrastructure was allocated by the colonial authorities to Dakars development. The port facilities were improved with jetties, a telegraph line was established along the coast to Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis and the Dakar-Saint-Louis railway was completed in 1885, at which point the city became an important base for the conquest of the western Sudan.\n \n \nGor\u00e9e, including Dakar, was recognised as a French commune in 1872. Dakar itself was split off from Gor\u00e9e as a separate commune in 1887. The citizens of the city elected their own mayor and municipal council and helped send an elected representative to the National Assembly in Paris. Dakar replaced Saint-Louis as the capital of French West Africa in 1902. A second major railroad, the Dakar-Niger railway|Dakar-Niger built from 1906\u20131923, linked Dakar to Bamako and consolidated the citys position at the head of Frances West African empire. In 1929, the commune of Gor\u00e9e Island, now with only a few hundred inhabitants, was merged into Dakar.\n\nUrbanization during the colonial period was marked by forms of racial and social segregation\u2014often expressed in terms of health and hygiene\u2014which continue to structure the city today. Following a plague epidemic in 1914, the authorities forced most of the African population out of old neighborhoods, or \"Plateau\", and into a new quarter, called M\u00e9dina, separated from it by a \"sanitary cordon\". As first occupants of the land, the Lebou inhabitants of the city successfully resisted this expropriation. They were supported by Blaise Diagne, the first African to be elected Deputy to the National Assembly. Nonetheless, the Plateau thereafter became an administrative, commercial, and residential district increasingly reserved for Europeans and served as model for similar exclusionary administrative enclaves in French Africas other colonial capitals (Bamako, Conakry, Abidjan, Brazzaville). Meanwhile, the Layene Sufi order, established by Seydina Mouhammadou Limamou Laye, was thriving among the Lebou in Yoff and in a new village called Camb\u00e9r\u00e8ne. Since independence, urbanization has sprawled eastward past Pikine, a commuter suburb whose population (2001 est. 1,200,000) is greater than that of Dakar proper, to Rufisque, creating a conurbation of almost 3&nbsp;million (over a quarter of the national population).\n\nIn its colonial heyday Dakar was one of the major cities of the French Empire, comparable to Hanoi or Beirut. French trading firms established branch offices there and industrial investments (mills, breweries, refineries, canneries) were attracted by its port and rail facilities. It was also strategically important to France, which maintained an important naval base and coaling station in its harbor and which integrated it into its earliest air force and airmail circuits, most notably with the legendary Mermoz airfield (no longer extant).\n\nDuring the Battle of Dakar, which took place off the coast of Dakar on September 23\u201325, 1940, the British navy attempted to rally the colonial administration in Dakar to the Allied cause and detach it from Vichy. In November 1944 West African conscripts of the French army mutinied against poor conditions at the Thiaroye camp, on the outskirts of the city. The mutiny was seen as an indictment of the colonial system and constituted a watershed for the nationalist movement.\n\nDakar was the capital of the short-lived Mali Federation from 1959 to 1960, after which it became the capital of Senegal. The poet, philosopher and first President of Senegal L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor tried to transform Dakar into the \"Sub-Saharan African Athens\" (l\u2019Ath\u00e8nes de l\u2019Afrique subsaharienne),  as his vision was for it.\n Lebanese community Cape Verdean, and Guinean communities. The city is home to as many as 20,000&nbsp;French expatriates. France still maintains an air force base at Yoff and the French fleet is serviced in Dakars port.\n\nBeginning 1978 and until 2007, Dakar was frequently the ending point of the Dakar Rally. The rally brought worldwide attention to the poverty of Senegal and Dakar. \n\n==Geography and climate==\n \nThe Dakarian climate is generally warm. Dakar has a hot semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: BSh), with a short rainy season and a lengthy dry season. Dakars rainy season lasts from July to October while the dry season covers the remaining eight months. The city sees approximately   of precipitation per year.\n\nDakar between December and May is usually pleasantly warm with daily temperatures around  . Nights during this time of the year are comfortable, some  . However, between May and November the city becomes decidedly warmer with daily highs reaching   and night lows a little bit above  . Notwithstanding this hotter season Dakars weather is far from being as hot as that of African cities inland, such as Niamey and NDjamena, where temperatures hover above   for much of the year. It has presumably the best climate settings in all western Africa, as it is cooled year-round with sea breezes.\n\n{{Weather box location = Dakar, Senegal metric first= Y single line= Y Jan record high C=37 Feb record high C=40 Mar record high C=40 Apr record high C=39 May record high C=37 Jun record high C=39 Jul record high C=40 Aug record high C=40 Sep record high C=42 Oct record high C=40 Nov record high C=43 Dec record high C=39\n Jan high C = 25 Feb high C = 24.6 Mar high C = 25 Apr high C = 25.3 May high C = 26.3 Jun high C = 28.9 Jul high C = 30 Aug high C = 30.1 Sep high C = 30.4 Oct high C = 30.4 Nov high C = 29 Dec high C = 26.5 year high C = 27.6\n Jan mean C=22 Feb mean C=21.7 Mar mean C=22.2 Apr mean C=22.6 May mean C=23.4 Jun mean C=26.5 Jul mean C=27.4 Aug mean C=27.4 Sep mean C=27.8 Oct mean C=28.1 Nov mean C=26.4 Dec mean C=23.6\n Jan low C = 17.4 Feb low C = 17 Mar low C = 17.4 Apr low C = 18.4 May low C = 20.2 Jun low C = 23.1 Jul low C = 24.5 Aug low C = 24.6 Sep low C = 24.4 Oct low C = 24.3 Nov low C = 22.5 Dec low C = 19.6 year low C = 21.1\n Jan record low C=11 Feb record low C=10 Mar record low C=10 Apr record low C=10 May record low C=17 Jun record low C=17 Jul record low C=13 Aug record low C=19 Sep record low C=17 Oct record low C=18 Nov record low C=16 Dec record low C=12\n Jan precipitation mm = 2.1 Feb precipitation mm = 1.3 Mar precipitation mm = 0 Apr precipitation mm = 0 May precipitation mm = 0 Jun precipitation mm = 10.2 Jul precipitation mm = 83.4 Aug precipitation mm = 184 Sep precipitation mm =  156.5 Oct precipitation mm =  51.6 Nov precipitation mm =  2.6 Dec precipitation mm =  2.6 year precipitation mm = 495.1\n\n  unit precipitation days = 1 mm\n Jan precipitation days = 0 Feb precipitation days = 0 Mar precipitation days = 0 Apr precipitation days = 0 May precipitation days = 0 Jun precipitation days = 1 Jul precipitation days = 4 Aug precipitation days = 9 Sep precipitation days = 8 Oct precipitation days = 2 Nov precipitation days = 0 Dec precipitation days = 0 year precipitation days = 25\n Jan humidity= 69 Feb humidity= 75 Mar humidity= 76 Apr humidity= 79 May humidity= 79 Jun humidity= 78 Jul humidity= 77 Aug humidity= 79 Sep humidity= 81 Oct humidity= 79 Nov humidity= 74 Dec humidity= 66 year humidity= 76\n Jan sun = 244.9 Feb sun = 245.8 Mar sun = 276 Apr sun = 288 May sun = 291.4 Jun sun = 252 Jul sun = 232.5 Aug sun = 223.2 Sep sun = 219 Oct sun = 257.3 Nov sun = 249 Dec sun = 238.7\n\n  Jan percentsun= 70 Feb percentsun= 74 Mar percentsun= 74 Apr percentsun= 74 May percentsun= 73 Jun percentsun= 65 Jul percentsun= 58 Aug percentsun= 57 Sep percentsun= 60 Oct percentsun= 70 Nov percentsun= 73 Dec percentsun= 69\n source 1 = Spiegel Online Wetter   \n\n|date=March 2012\n source 2 = Climate-Data.org for mean temperatures,  Voodoo Skies for records   \n\n}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Dakar mean sea temperature   \n|-\n!Jan\n!Feb\n!Mar\n!Apr\n!May\n!Jun\n!Jul\n!Aug\n!Sep\n!Oct\n!Nov\n!Dec\n|-\n| \n| \n| \n| \n| \n| \n| \n| \n| \n| \n| \n| \n|}\n\n==Administration==\n \n \nThe city of Dakar is a commune (subnational entity)|commune, (also sometimes known as commune de ville), one of the 67&nbsp;communes of Senegal. The commune of Dakar was created by the French colonial administration on June 17, 1887 by detaching it from the commune of Gor\u00e9e. The commune of Gor\u00e9e, created in 1872, was itself one of the oldest Western-style municipalities in Africa (along with the municipalities of Algeria and South Africa).\n Mamadou Diop, mayor for 18&nbsp;years between 1984 and 2002.\n\nThe commune of Dakar is also a d\u00e9partement, one of the 34&nbsp;d\u00e9partements of Senegal. This situation is quite similar to Paris, which is both a commune and a d\u00e9partement. However, contrary to French d\u00e9partements, d\u00e9partements in Senegal have no political power (no departmental assembly), and are merely local administrative structures of the central state, in charge of carrying out some administrative services as well as controlling the activities of the communes within the d\u00e9partement.\n departmental arrondissements.\n \n \nIn 1996 a massive reform of the administrative and political divisions of Senegal was voted by the Parliament of Senegal. The commune of Dakar, whose population approached 1&nbsp;million inhabitants, was deemed too large and too populated to be properly managed by a central municipality, and thus on August 30, 1996 Dakar was divided into 19&nbsp;communes darrondissement. These communes darrondissement were given extensive powers, and are very much like regular communes. They have more powers than the arrondissements of Paris, and are more akin to the London boroughs. The commune of Dakar was maintained above these 19&nbsp;communes darrondissement, and it coordinates the activities of the communes darrondissement, much as Greater London coordinates the activities of the London boroughs. The 19&nbsp;communes darrondissement belong to either of the four arrondissements of Dakar, and the prefect|sous-pr\u00e9fet of each arrondissement is in charge of controlling the activities of the communes darrondissement in his arrondissement.\n\nThe commune darrondissement of Dakar-Plateau (34,626 inhabitants), in the arrondissement of Plateau/Gor\u00e9e, is the historical heart of the city, and most ministries and public administrations are located there. The densest and most populous commune darrondissement is M\u00e9dina (136,697&nbsp;inhabitants), in the arrondissement of Plateau/Gor\u00e9e. The commune darrondissement of Yoff (55,995&nbsp;inhabitants), in the arrondissement of Almadies, is the largest one, while the smallest one is the commune darrondissement of Gor\u00e9e|\u00cele de Gor\u00e9e (1,034&nbsp;inhabitants), in the arrondissement of Plateau/Gor\u00e9e.\n Cape Verde Peninsula. Its territory is thus roughly the same as the territory of the metropolitan area of Dakar. Since the administrative reforms of 1996, the r\u00e9gions of Senegal, which until then were merely local administrative structures of the central state, have been turned into full-fledged political units, with democratically elected regional councils, and regional presidents. They were given extensive powers, and manage economic development, transportation, or environmental protection issues at the regional level, thus coordinating the actions of the communes below them.\n\nAbdoulaye Wade was re-elected in 2007.\n\n==Notable places==\n \n \n ]] tallest statue in Africa, clifftop walks and beaches, and  , aka the Senegal Zoo.\n\nThe town serves as a port and is home to the Dakar-Yoff-L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor International Airport|L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor International Airport.

It is the westernmost country in the mainland of the Old World or Eurafrasia  and owes its name to the S\u00e9n\u00e9gal River that borders it to the east and north. Senegal is externally bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, Mauritania to the north, Mali to the east, and Guinea and Guinea-Bissau to the south; internally it almost completely surrounds Gambia, namely on the north, east and south, except for Gambias short Atlantic coastline. Senegal covers a land area of almost  , and has an estimated population of about 13 million. The climate is tropical with two seasons: the dry season and the rainy season.\n\nDakar, the capital city of Senegal, is located at the westernmost tip of the country on the Cap-Vert peninsula. About   off the coast lie the Cape Verde Islands. During the 17th and 18th centuries, numerous trading posts belonging to various European colonial empires were established along the coast. After French colonization of the territory called French West Africa (Afrique occidentale fran\u00e7aise, or AOF), the town of St. Louis became the capital; in 1902 it was succeeded by Dakar. When Senegal gained independence from France in 1960, it affirmed its capital as Dakar.\n\nThe country is part of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Integrated with the main bodies of the international community, Senegal is also a member of the African Union (AU) and the Community of Sahel-Saharan States. Since 2 April 2012, the countrys president has been Macky Sall.\n\n==Etymology==  Wolof phrase Berber Zenaga people, who lived on the northern side of the river. A competing theory is that it derives from the medieval town of \"Sanghana\" (also spelled as Isenghan, Asengan, Singhanah), described by the Arab geographer al-Bakri in 1068 as located by the mouth of the river. The \"our canoe\" theory has been popularly embraced in modern Senegal for its charm and its use in appeals to national solidarity (e.g. \"were all in the same canoe\") are frequently heard in the media. \n Serer term Sene (from Roge Sene, Supreme Deity in Serer religion) and O Gal (meaning \"body of water\").\n\n==History==\n \n  according to Muhammad al-Idrisi.]]\n\n===Early and pre-colonial eras===\nArchaeological findings throughout the area indicate that Senegal was inhabited in prehistoric times and has been continuously occupied by various ethnic groups. Some kingdoms were created around the 7th century: Takrur in the 9th century, Namandiru and the Jolof Empire during the 13th and 14th centuries. Eastern Senegal was once part of the Ghana Empire.\n Toucouleur and Soninke contact Wolof converted peacefully due to the intervention of leaders such as Amadou Bamba, Malik Sy and Sayyidun\u00e2 Muhammad Al-imam Laye, who brought their followers with them. .  They saw Islam as a way to unite and fight against colonial power.\n\nIn the 13th and 14th centuries, the area came under the influence of the empires to the east; the Jolof Empire of Senegal was also founded during this time. In the Senegambia region, between 1300 and 1900, close to one-third of the population was Slavery in Africa|enslaved, typically as a result of captives taken in warfare. \n Serer   and part Toucouleur people|Toucouleur, who was able to form a coalition with many ethnicities, but collapsed around 1549 with the defeat and killing of Lele Fouli Fak by Amari Ngone Sobel Fall.\n\n===Colonial era===\nIn the mid-15th century, the Portuguese landed on the Senegal coastline, followed by traders representing other countries, including the French.  Various European powers\u2014Portugal, the Netherlands, and Great Britain\u2014competed for trade in the area from the 15th century onward. In 1677, France gained control of what had become a minor departure point in the Atlantic slave trade\u2014the island of Gor\u00e9e next to modern Dakar, used as a base to purchase slaves from the warring chiefdoms on the mainland.    \n , 18th century.]]\n\nEuropean missionaries introduced Christianity to Senegal and the Casamance in the 19th century. It was only in the 1850s that the French began to expand onto the Senegalese mainland \u2013 they had abolished slavery and promoted an  , Damel of Cayor, and Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof, the Maad a Sinig of Sine, resulting in the Battle of Logand\u00e8me.\n\n===Independence and modern era===\nOn 4 April 1959 Senegal and the French Sudan merged to form the Mali Federation, which became fully independent on 20 June 1960, as a result of the independence and the transfer of power agreement signed with France on 4 April 1960. Due to internal political difficulties, the Federation broke up on 20 August, when Senegal and French Sudan (renamed the Republic of Mali) each proclaimed independence.\n\nL\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor was proclaimed Senegals first president in September 1960. Senghor was a very well-read man, educated in France. He was a poet, a philosopher and personally drafted the Senegalese national anthem, \"Pincez tous vos koras, frappez les balafons\". Pro-African, he advocated a brand of African socialism. \n  c. 1900. Europeans and Africans on the Rue Lebon.]] In 1980, President Senghor decided to retire from politics. The next year, he transferred power in 1981 to his hand-picked successor, Abdou Diouf. Former prime minister Mamadou Dia, who was Senghors rival, ran for election in 1983 against Diouf but lost. Senghor moved to France, where he died at the age of 96.\n\nSenegal joined with the Gambia to form the nominal Senegambia Confederation on 1 February 1982. However, the union was dissolved in 1989. Despite peace talks, a southern separatist group (Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance or MFDC) in the Casamance region has clashed sporadically with government forces since 1982 in the Casamance conflict. In the early 21st century, violence has subsided and President Macky Sall held talks with rebels in Rome in December 2012. \n\nSenegal has had a long history of participating in international peacekeeping.   \n\nAbdou Diouf was president between 1981 and 2000. He encouraged broader political participation, reduced government involvement in the economy, and widened Senegals diplomatic engagements, particularly with other developing nations. Domestic politics on occasion spilled over into street violence, border tensions, and a violent separatist movement in the southern region of the Casamance. Nevertheless, Senegals commitment to democracy and human rights strengthened. Abdou Diouf served four terms as president.\n\nIn the presidential election of 1999, opposition leader Abdoulaye Wade defeated Diouf in an election deemed free and fair by international observers. Senegal experienced its second peaceful transition of power, and its first from one political party to another. On 30 December 2004 President Wade announced that he would sign a peace treaty with the separatist group in the Casamance region. This, however, has yet to be implemented. There was a round of talks in 2005, but the results have not yet  yielded a resolution.\n\nToday, Gor\u00e9e island is a massive tourist site for Senegal. Its rich history has lured famous people including recent visitors, President of the United States of America, Barack Obama and the first lady Michelle Obama on 27 June 2013.  Gor\u00e9e Islands cultural significance has allowed it to be recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site.  In order to maintain the authenticity of the island and its buildings, it is against the law for the inhabitants of the island to add any improvements to the houses and structures that have been present for centuries.\n\n==Politics==\n \n , current president of Senegal (2012 until now)]]\n , president of Senegal (2000\u20132012)]]\n elected every five years as of 2001, previously being seven years, by adult voters.

Senegals second president, Abdou Diouf is the current general secretary of the Organisation de la Francophonie. The third president was Abdoulaye Wade, a lawyer. The current president is Macky Sall, elected in March 2012.\n National Assembly, which has 120&nbsp;seats, and the Senate (Senegal)|Senate, which has 100&nbsp;seats and was reinstituted in 2007.  An independent judiciary also exists in Senegal.

In 2009, however, Freedom House downgraded Senegals status from Free to Partially Free, based on increased centralisation of power in the executive.\n\nIn 2008, Senegal finished in 12th position on the Ibrahim Index of African Governance.    The Ibrahim Index is a comprehensive measure of African governance (limited to sub-Saharan Africa until 2008), based on a number of different variables which reflect the success with which governments deliver essential political goods to their citizens. When the Northern African countries were added to the index in 2009, Senegals 2008 position was retroactively downgraded to 15th place (with Tunisia, Egypt and Morocco placing themselves ahead of Senegal). As of 2012, Senegals rank in the Ibrahim Index has decreased another point to 16 out of 52 African countries.\n\nOn 22 February 2011, it was reported that Senegal has severed diplomatic ties with Iran, saying Tehran supplied rebels with weapons which killed Senegalese troops in the Casamance conflict.\n Alliance for the Republic won, and Wade conceded the election to Sall. This peaceful and democratic transition was hailed by many foreign observers, such as the EU  as a show of \"maturity\".\n\nOn 19 September 2012, lawmakers voted to do away with the senate to save an estimated $15 million. \n\n==OFNAC==\nNational Anti-Corruption (OFNAC) and the Commission of restitution and recovery of illegally acquired assets. According to Business Anti-Corruption Portal, President Sall created the OFNAC to replace the Commission Nationale de Lutte Contre la non Transparence, la Corruption et la Concussion (CNLCC). It is said that the OFNAC represents a more effective tool for fighting corruption than the CNLCC established under former President Wade.  The mission of OFNAC is to fight corruption, embezzlement of public funds and fraud. OFNAC has the power of self-referral (own initiative investigation). OFNAC is composed of twelve members appointed by decree.\n\n==Geography==\n \n ]]\nSenegal is located on the west of the African continent.

A modern messianic sect in Islam, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is also present in the country which represents approximately 1% of the Muslim population.   \n Mankanya and Balant populations, and in eastern Senegal among the Bassari and Coniagui. The Protestant churches are mainly attended by immigrants but during the second half of the 20th century Protestant churches led by Senegalese leaders from different ethnic groups have evolved. In Dakar Catholic and Protestant rites are practiced by the Lebanese, Cape Verdean, European, and American immigrant populations, and among certain Africans of other countries as well as by the Senegalese themselves.

It is the westernmost country in the mainland of the Old World or Eurafrasia  and owes its name to the S\u00e9n\u00e9gal River that borders it to the east and north. Senegal is externally bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, Mauritania to the north, Mali to the east, and Guinea and Guinea-Bissau to the south; internally it almost completely surrounds Gambia, namely on the north, east and south, except for Gambias short Atlantic coastline. Senegal covers a land area of almost  , and has an estimated population of about 13 million. The climate is tropical with two seasons: the dry season and the rainy season.\n\nDakar, the capital city of Senegal, is located at the westernmost tip of the country on the Cap-Vert peninsula. About   off the coast lie the Cape Verde Islands. During the 17th and 18th centuries, numerous trading posts belonging to various European colonial empires were established along the coast. After French colonization of the territory called French West Africa (Afrique occidentale fran\u00e7aise, or AOF), the town of St. Louis became the capital; in 1902 it was succeeded by Dakar. When Senegal gained independence from France in 1960, it affirmed its capital as Dakar.\n\nThe country is part of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Integrated with the main bodies of the international community, Senegal is also a member of the African Union (AU) and the Community of Sahel-Saharan States. Since 2 April 2012, the countrys president has been Macky Sall.\n\n==Etymology==  Wolof phrase Berber Zenaga people, who lived on the northern side of the river. A competing theory is that it derives from the medieval town of \"Sanghana\" (also spelled as Isenghan, Asengan, Singhanah), described by the Arab geographer al-Bakri in 1068 as located by the mouth of the river. The \"our canoe\" theory has been popularly embraced in modern Senegal for its charm and its use in appeals to national solidarity (e.g. \"were all in the same canoe\") are frequently heard in the media. \n Serer term Sene (from Roge Sene, Supreme Deity in Serer religion) and O Gal (meaning \"body of water\").\n\n==History==\n \n  according to Muhammad al-Idrisi.]]\n\n===Early and pre-colonial eras===\nArchaeological findings throughout the area indicate that Senegal was inhabited in prehistoric times and has been continuously occupied by various ethnic groups. Some kingdoms were created around the 7th century: Takrur in the 9th century, Namandiru and the Jolof Empire during the 13th and 14th centuries. Eastern Senegal was once part of the Ghana Empire.\n Toucouleur and Soninke contact Wolof converted peacefully due to the intervention of leaders such as Amadou Bamba, Malik Sy and Sayyidun\u00e2 Muhammad Al-imam Laye, who brought their followers with them. .  They saw Islam as a way to unite and fight against colonial power.\n\nIn the 13th and 14th centuries, the area came under the influence of the empires to the east; the Jolof Empire of Senegal was also founded during this time. In the Senegambia region, between 1300 and 1900, close to one-third of the population was Slavery in Africa|enslaved, typically as a result of captives taken in warfare. \n Serer   and part Toucouleur people|Toucouleur, who was able to form a coalition with many ethnicities, but collapsed around 1549 with the defeat and killing of Lele Fouli Fak by Amari Ngone Sobel Fall.\n\n===Colonial era===\nIn the mid-15th century, the Portuguese landed on the Senegal coastline, followed by traders representing other countries, including the French.  Various European powers\u2014Portugal, the Netherlands, and Great Britain\u2014competed for trade in the area from the 15th century onward. In 1677, France gained control of what had become a minor departure point in the Atlantic slave trade\u2014the island of Gor\u00e9e next to modern Dakar, used as a base to purchase slaves from the warring chiefdoms on the mainland.    \n , 18th century.]]\n\nEuropean missionaries introduced Christianity to Senegal and the Casamance in the 19th century. It was only in the 1850s that the French began to expand onto the Senegalese mainland \u2013 they had abolished slavery and promoted an  , Damel of Cayor, and Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof, the Maad a Sinig of Sine, resulting in the Battle of Logand\u00e8me.\n\n===Independence and modern era===\nOn 4 April 1959 Senegal and the French Sudan merged to form the Mali Federation, which became fully independent on 20 June 1960, as a result of the independence and the transfer of power agreement signed with France on 4 April 1960. Due to internal political difficulties, the Federation broke up on 20 August, when Senegal and French Sudan (renamed the Republic of Mali) each proclaimed independence.\n\nL\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor was proclaimed Senegals first president in September 1960. Senghor was a very well-read man, educated in France. He was a poet, a philosopher and personally drafted the Senegalese national anthem, \"Pincez tous vos koras, frappez les balafons\". Pro-African, he advocated a brand of African socialism. \n  c. 1900. Europeans and Africans on the Rue Lebon.]] In 1980, President Senghor decided to retire from politics. The next year, he transferred power in 1981 to his hand-picked successor, Abdou Diouf. Former prime minister Mamadou Dia, who was Senghors rival, ran for election in 1983 against Diouf but lost. Senghor moved to France, where he died at the age of 96.\n\nSenegal joined with the Gambia to form the nominal Senegambia Confederation on 1 February 1982. However, the union was dissolved in 1989. Despite peace talks, a southern separatist group (Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance or MFDC) in the Casamance region has clashed sporadically with government forces since 1982 in the Casamance conflict. In the early 21st century, violence has subsided and President Macky Sall held talks with rebels in Rome in December 2012. \n\nSenegal has had a long history of participating in international peacekeeping.   \n\nAbdou Diouf was president between 1981 and 2000. He encouraged broader political participation, reduced government involvement in the economy, and widened Senegals diplomatic engagements, particularly with other developing nations. Domestic politics on occasion spilled over into street violence, border tensions, and a violent separatist movement in the southern region of the Casamance. Nevertheless, Senegals commitment to democracy and human rights strengthened. Abdou Diouf served four terms as president.\n\nIn the presidential election of 1999, opposition leader Abdoulaye Wade defeated Diouf in an election deemed free and fair by international observers. Senegal experienced its second peaceful transition of power, and its first from one political party to another. On 30 December 2004 President Wade announced that he would sign a peace treaty with the separatist group in the Casamance region. This, however, has yet to be implemented. There was a round of talks in 2005, but the results have not yet  yielded a resolution.\n\nToday, Gor\u00e9e island is a massive tourist site for Senegal. Its rich history has lured famous people including recent visitors, President of the United States of America, Barack Obama and the first lady Michelle Obama on 27 June 2013.  Gor\u00e9e Islands cultural significance has allowed it to be recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site.  In order to maintain the authenticity of the island and its buildings, it is against the law for the inhabitants of the island to add any improvements to the houses and structures that have been present for centuries.\n\n==Politics==\n \n , current president of Senegal (2012 until now)]]\n , president of Senegal (2000\u20132012)]]\n elected every five years as of 2001, previously being seven years, by adult voters. The first president, L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor, was a poet and writer, and was the first African elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise. Senegals second president, Abdou Diouf is the current general secretary of the Organisation de la Francophonie. The third president was Abdoulaye Wade, a lawyer. The current president is Macky Sall, elected in March 2012.\n National Assembly, which has 120&nbsp;seats, and the Senate (Senegal)|Senate, which has 100&nbsp;seats and was reinstituted in 2007.  An independent judiciary also exists in Senegal. The nations highest courts that deal with business issues are the constitutional council and the court of justice, members of which are named by the president.\n Muslim brotherhoods, also exercise a strong political influence in the country especially during Wades presidency. In 2009, however, Freedom House downgraded Senegals status from Free to Partially Free, based on increased centralisation of power in the executive.\n\nIn 2008, Senegal finished in 12th position on the Ibrahim Index of African Governance.
